A matlab GUI designed to analyze GPS, GRACE and GLDAS data together. A lot of comments and try-thorws are needed.

This project is to show GPS data from a fixed GPS station and compare them with other data like GRACE or GLDAS repository. 

Start from GPSWORK.m. Recommended way of usage is included in GPSWORKDocuments.txt.

Static like correlation, phase difference or draconic can be performed. You may also add your own static function through DataAnalyzer view.
